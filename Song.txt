# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a Goose, 
drinking some Juice?"
Down by the bay.

#Down-by-the-Bay with other things

Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"did you see a man, 
stuck in a can?"
Down by the bay.

#One more time

Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"have you ever seen a seal, 
eating a meal?"
Down by the bay.
